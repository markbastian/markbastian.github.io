    <h3>Clojure on the Rise</h3>
    <h3>
        <small>May 28, 2017</small>
    </h3>
    <b>Introduction</b><br/>
    It's been a while since I've maintained my blog over at <a href="https://fn-code.blogspot.com">fn-code</a>.
    Rather than belabor the details, here's a summary of why I haven't been actively blogging for over a year:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>I changed jobs and moved from New Mexico to Idaho at the end of 2015 which entailed a lot of disruption
            in my life.</li>
        <li>I have other interests and have to balance my time. Family, personal coding projects, learning IoT, reading
            books, playing games, etc., etc., etc.</li>
        <li>Google modified Drive to no longer serve up JavaScript libraries. Finding and implementing a <i>good</i>
            workaround has been a time suck.</li>
        <li>Blogging is hard. If you don't believe me, try to write an informative and interesting post. Then continue
            to do so on a regular basis.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <b>I'm back - I hope</b><br/>
    The above said, I keep coming back to my blog and thinking I really need to get back into it. The recent kerfuffle
    on Twitter regarding the supposed death of Clojure has pushed me over the edge and I am going to try to get regular
    posts out again, starting with this one.
    <b>Clojure is alive and well in my life - and it explains my current silence</b><br/>
    When I started at Clearwater Analytics in 2015 I was basically the only Clojure developer at a Java-centric company.
    We had two other fans that I knew about and a large number of people were familiar with Rich Hickey's classics
    (esp. "The Value of Values"), but nobody was writing Clojure professionally.

    I have become the de facto Chief Clojure Evangelist at my company.
